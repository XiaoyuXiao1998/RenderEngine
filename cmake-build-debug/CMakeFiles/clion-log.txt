CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "assimp" with any
  of the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "assimp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "assimp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "assimp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
